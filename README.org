Description and examples to set up [[https://www.gnupg.org/][The GNU Privacy Gurad]] key management-

* Overview
The basic setup is based on https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys, which will create one primary signing key pair, which should never be stored on the machine. Instead, subkeys are used for the daily work like encrypting or signing messages. The primary key pair is stored on a portable media, like an USB disk and only mounted and used, when needed. The backups of the current key setup together with their primary keys are stored on the media as well. The file structure of the media should look like something like:
#+begin_example
  +-README.org
  +-gnupg.0.tar
  +-gnupg.1.tar
  ...
  +-gnupg.N.tar
#+end_example

With =README.org= is this file and =gnupg.<x>.tar= are backups, with =gnupg.0.tar= the first and =gnupg.N.tar= the most current.
